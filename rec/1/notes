fstream helps to open read and write file
sstream helps to treat a string as a stream of characters

create an instance:
	ifstream inFile;
open a file:
	inFile.open("filename.txt")

create a stringstream variable from string data:
	initialize the "ss" with data
		stringstream ss(data);

struct is a collection of data elements grouped together to create a composite data type
creating a struct type: template to define all instances
	struct CarData{
	string model;
	string make;
	int year;
	}

array of structs
structs can also be used as the type of an array, just like int or string or bool
	CarData carArray[10];
	for (int i=0;i<10;i++){
		cout<<carArray[i].make<<carArray[i].model<<carArray[i].year<<endl;
	}
